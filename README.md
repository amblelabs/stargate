  What does this mod add?
</h2>

This mod adds a new way to travel around your minecraft world and its many dimensions!
This large ring structure can be found naturally in the deserts of your world (simulary to the show).

When a stargate is activated, it will create a wormhole to another stargate, allowing players to travel between the two points.

Each stargate has its own unique address consisting of 7 points; 6 of them used as points of reference in space, and the 7th being its "Point of Origin".

To keep the minecraft theme, instead of using the same glyphs as the series does, we've decided to use the minecraft standard galactic alphabet (each symbol corrisponds with a letter from the alphabet). Please see the Gallery to see what letter is what symbol.

  How do I use this mod?
</h2>

Once you have discovered a stargate, you can dial it in one of three ways:

- Dial-Home Device
- Spectral Projector
- Manual Dialing

### DHD (Dial-Home Device)

The DHD is a costly but efficient way to easily dial a stargate.

On the DHD, you will find the same symbols as seen on the gate. To dial a stargate, you must press the corresponding chevron symbols on the DHD in the correct order.

Right-click the DHD to dial the address related to the stargate that has that same address. (the DHD will need to be linked to a stargate to work)

### Spectral Projector

Unlike the DHD, the Spectral Projector is a much cheaper way to dial a stargate.

It is a one-time use item that allows you to dial a stargate by linking it to the gate you wish to dial, you then right-click it on the stargate you want to travel from!

### Manual Dialing

You can manually input an address by right-clicking the stargate.

Right-click the gate to rotate it clockwise, shift right-click the gate to lock in the current symbol/chevron.
