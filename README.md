## What does this add?

This mod adds a new block called the Stargate.

The stargate is a one-way portal. 

It is a large ring structure found naturally in the deserts of your world.

When a stargate is activated, it will create a wormhole to another stargate, allowing players to travel between the two points.

Each stargate has its own unique address, with the last chevron being its "Point of Origin" ( Minecraft Dimension - symbol is datapack definable! )

## How do I use it?

Once you have discovered a stargate, you can dial it in one of three ways:

- Dial-Home Device
- Spectral Projector
- Manual Dialing

### Dial-Home Device ( DHD )

The DHD is a costly but efficient way to dial a stargate.

On the DHD, there are rings of chevron symbols. To dial a stargate, you must press the corresponding chevron symbols on the DHD.

Right-click the DHD to dial the address of the stargate it is linked to.

### Spectral Projector

The Spectral Projector is a cheaper way to dial a stargate.

It is a one-time use item that allows you to dial a stargate by linking it to the stargate you want to dial, and then right-clicking it again on another stargate.

### Manual Dialing ( Only with Tech Energy! )

You can manually input an address by right-clicking the stargate.

Right-click to rotate clockwise, shift right-click to lock in the current chevron.

This drains 250 power per usage.


## Power Compatibility

If any Tech Energy power mod is present, then compatability is enabled.

This then requires the stargate to have at least 25000+ power to dial.

You can check its power level by right-clicking it (temp) or the colour of the chevrons.
